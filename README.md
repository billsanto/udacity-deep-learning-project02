# udacity-deep-learning-project02
Udacity image classification project using CIFAR 10 images and tensorflow using Jupyter notebook and Python 3.5

This project built a convolutional neural network using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The goal was to predict the class for 60000 32x32 pixed images.  All images are among one of 10 classes.
